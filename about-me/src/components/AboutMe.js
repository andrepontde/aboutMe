              My interests extend beyond pure technology. I'm fascinated by psychology and its intersection 
              with technology, which has led to some of my most innovative projects.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also have extensive knowledge in computer hardware, having built and configured systems since my early teens.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm always exploring new technologies and methodologies, but I've found that Java and Python 
              form the perfect combination for most of my work - Java for robust system-level applications 
              and Python for AI and high-level data processing.

            <p>
              My relationship with technology began at age 8, and it has been a constant companion ever since. 
              What started as curiosity about how computers work evolved into a deep passion for software 
              development, system architecture, and artificial intelligence.
            </p>
            <p>
              Moving from MÃ©xico to Ireland for my studies was a pivotal decision that has shaped both my 
              technical skills and global perspective.
            </p>
            <p>
              I believe in the power of technology to solve real-world problems and am always thinking about 
              how software can contribute to my community. Every project I undertake is driven by this 
              philosophy of meaningful impact.

              I'm actively seeking opportunities to apply my diverse skill set in environments that value 
              innovation, clean code, and meaningful impact. My goal is to work on projects that not only 
              solve technical challenges but also contribute positively to communities and businesses.

              modern technology.
            </p>
            <p>
              Whether working independently or as part of a team, I focus on clear communication, thorough 
              documentation, and collaborative development practices that lead to successful project outcomes.
