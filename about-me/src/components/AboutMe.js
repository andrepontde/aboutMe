        <p className="intro-text">
          I'm AndrÃ© Pont De Anda, a 22-year-old Computer Science student at the National College of Ireland, 
          currently in my third year. Originally from MÃ©xico, I chose to study abroad to pursue better 
          opportunities and broaden my horizons. I'm passionate about creating software solutions that 
          make a meaningful impact on communities and businesses.

            <h3>Beyond Code</h3>
            <p>
              My interests extend beyond pure technology. I'm fascinated by psychology and its intersection 
              with technology, which has led to some of my most innovative projects. I also have extensive 
              knowledge in computer hardware, having built and configured systems since my early teens.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm always exploring new technologies and methodologies, but I've found that Java and Python 
              form the perfect combination for most of my work - Java for robust system-level applications 
              and Python for AI and high-level data processing.

            <h3>My Journey</h3>
            <p>
              My relationship with technology began at age 8, and it has been a constant companion ever since. 
              What started as curiosity about how computers work evolved into a deep passion for software 
              development, system architecture, and artificial intelligence. Moving from MÃ©xico to Ireland 
              for my studies was a pivotal decision that has shaped both my technical skills and global perspective.
            </p>
            <p>
              I believe in the power of technology to solve real-world problems and am always thinking about 
              how software can contribute to my community. Every project I undertake is driven by this 
              philosophy of meaningful impact.
