          I'm Andr√© Pont De Anda, a passionate computing student with a strong foundation in backend development 
          and a growing interest in artificial intelligence. I thrive on solving complex problems and building 
          scalable solutions that make a real impact.

          <h3>My Journey</h3>
          <p>
            Currently pursuing my studies at National College of Ireland, I've developed a deep appreciation 
            for the intersection of technology and problem-solving. My journey began with curiosity about 
            how systems work behind the scenes, which naturally led me to backend development where I can 
            architect and build the foundations that power applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            What excites me most about development is the constant learning curve. Every project presents 
            new challenges that push me to explore different technologies, optimize performance, and think 
            creatively about solutions. This adaptability has become one of my strongest assets as a developer.
